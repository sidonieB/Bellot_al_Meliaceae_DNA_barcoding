This directory contains successful Sanger sequences obtained from PCR products, for PCRs performed on wood DNA.   
Details are provided in Table S2 of the publication.  
Sequences that were from contaminants or that had failed were not included.  
The geneious file contains all cchromatograms with annotations of any edits made.   
The subdirectories contain chromatograms in ab1 format, so annotations where edits have been made are not included, but both the original and edited chromatograms are included (in separate directories)
